Smart Contact Manager
Built a full-stack contact management web application with Spring Boot as the backend and Thymeleaf for the frontend using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Implemented user authentication via both Google OAuth and traditional login. Users can add, view, and manage contacts with descriptions and profile photos. Integrated Cloudinary for seamless contact image upload and storage.
